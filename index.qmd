# What They Forgot to Teach You About R {-}

## About {-}

## Warning

This is book is a work in progress.
:::

This book focuses on content intrinsically related to programming in R, 
but does not delve into the programming itself.

Section 1 discusses building holistic and project-oriented workflows that address common sources of friction in data analysis. 

Section 2 describes your personal R administration, which empowers R users to confidently manage their R programming environment.

Section 3 showcases functions, options, and RStudio capabilities for 
debugging code, facilitating more efficient resolution of errant code. 

## Audience {-}

The target learner for this material:

  * Has a moderate amount of R and RStudio experience.
  * Is largely self-taught.
  * Suspects they have drifted into some idiosyncratic habits that may slow
    them down or make their work products more brittle.
  * Is interested in (re)designing their R lifestyle, to be more effective and
    more self-sufficient.

## Origin {-}

The initial impetus for creating this book was a two-day hands-on workshop first instructed in 2018. The workshop materials and this book will likely continue to both overlap and diverge in content.
